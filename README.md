Against the trend stratey

Price must hit a pre determined support
Once hit price MUST then close ABOVE the SUPPORT and ABOVE the MA5 HIGH 
Price must then pull back DOWN and MUST test the MA5 LOW
At MA5 LOW enter the trade LONG
STOP goes 1 point BELOW the previous LOW point after the support was hit.
TakeProfit is 3 times the entry Stop distance (3:1)
